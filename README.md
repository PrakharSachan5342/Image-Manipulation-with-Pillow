# Image-Manipulation-with-Pillow
Python Imaging Library (PIL) to perform image manipulation tasks. It first opens an image file called 'image.jpg'. Then, it converts the image to grayscale using the convert('L') method, producing a black and white version of the image. Next, a blur filter is applied to the original image using the filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)
